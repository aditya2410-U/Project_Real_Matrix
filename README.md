### **Project Plan(Timeline has been added)**

### **Project Overview**
The Code Collab Project is a real-time code collaboration tool aimed at providing developers with a seamless environment for writing and sharing code. This tool integrates features like live code editing, real-time communication, and code versioning to facilitate team collaboration.

Our goal is to create an all-in-one IDE-like platform where developers can collaborate on projects with real-time feedback, making the development process smoother and more interactive.

## **Features**
- **Real-time code collaboration**: Multiple users can work on the same codebase with real-time syncing.
- **Built-in compiler**: Compile and run code directly from the platform.
- **Role-based access control**: Users have different access levels (read/write) depending on their role.
- **Version control**: Integrated version control system to manage code changes.
- **In-app communication**: Real-time chat functionality for seamless developer communication.
